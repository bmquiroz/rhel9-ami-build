ssg-rhel9-ds-tailoring_vra.xml has rootlogin control disabled. 
This is because VRA is configured to login to the system as root 
on initial build, and disabling this breaks VRA. Ideally it should
be using a service account with keys and sudo but it is what it is
for anywhere else where this is not required the root login should 
be disabled.
